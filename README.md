# splash-labyrinth

This is an implementation of the 2 player reactor game called blue dot.

There are 2 players and a grid of walls, some walls dissapear randomly in time, this forms a sort of labyrinth.
When a player first presses the button to check if there's a path to the exit the game checks and if it's true, that player wins, if not, that player loses.
